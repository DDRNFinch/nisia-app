/* Evia7 brain: what makes Evia's chat useful without an AI service. Everything is worked out on the phone, from

     Today       the learner's day: up to three things to do now, most urgent first, each one tap into the app.
     Ask Evia    typed questions: site calculations (bricks, blocks, mortar, concrete, stairs, falls, 3-4-5, areas,
                 conversions and sums), tools, materials and site terms (the glossary, with Teach me pictures),
                 KSBs in plain English with where the learner is on each, "what should I do next?", how to do
                 things in the app, and anything in the Teach me lessons. She remembers the last calculation, so
                 "what about 6 m?" works, and ends each answer with what to ask next.
